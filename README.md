# SPARQLPrompt - A Chrome Extension to assist with writing SPARQL queries

## Description
SPARQLPrompt is a Chrome Extension designed for use with the site https://yasgui.triply.cc/# and to generate queries for the Ubergraph endpoint https://ubergraph.apps.renci.org/sparql. SPARQLPrompt allows the user to ask a question about an ontology in natural language and the Extension converts into a SPARQL query. SPARQLPrompt uses OpenAI to convert the natural language question into SPARQL, therefore an OpenAI API key is needed to use the Extension.

## Context artifacts
- Context JSON is generated by the `omnigraph-agent` repo (via its context builder).
- Context files are stored in the `omnigraph-agent` repository and loaded directly from GitHub.
- These files describe graph schemas, useful dimensions, filters, and example SPARQL patterns. The extension loads them to enrich NL→SPARQL prompting.

## Context file selection
- Users can select context files directly from the extension UI, regardless of which page/graph they're querying.
- Available options:
  - **Omnigraph repo URL**: Select one or more context files from the `omnigraph-agent` repository on GitHub. Multiple files can be selected and will be automatically merged.
  - **Custom URL**: Enter any URL to load a context file from the web.
  - **Manual paste/upload**: Paste context directly into the textarea or upload a file.
- The selected context is loaded into the context textarea where it can be viewed and edited before use.
- The context is used to enrich the NL→SPARQL prompt generation.

## NL→SPARQL flow with context
1. User selects a context source (Omnigraph repo files, custom URL, or manual input).
2. The extension loads the context content into the context textarea (multiple files are merged automatically).
3. User can review and edit the context if needed.
4. When generating SPARQL, the context is appended to the user's natural language question.
5. The OpenAI API generates SPARQL using both the user's question and the provided context.
6. The resulting SPARQL is displayed and can be pasted into YASGUI or FRINK.

## Installation
- Clone or download the code. For stable versions, use the [latest release](https://github.com/twhetzel/sparql-chrome-extension/releases.)
- Open your Chrome browser and go to Settings --> Extensions
- Click on "Load unpacked". This will open a file browser. Select the entire folder that contains the Chrome Extension. A new card will be added to your Extensions for the SPARQLPrompt.
- In the upper-right hand side of the browser, click on the Extensions icon and pin the SPARQLPrompt Extension so the icon remains visible in your Chrome browser.
- Click on the SPARQLPrompt icon, which will launch a pop-up window where you can enter your OpenAI API key.
- The OpenAI API key is stored as plain text in `chrome.storage.local` on your machine. Avoid installing this extension on shared machines unless you trust all users. You can clear the saved key by opening Chrome DevTools on `https://yasgui.triply.cc/#` and running:
    ```
    chrome.storage.local.remove('openai_api_key');
    ```
- Navigate to https://yasgui.triply.cc/#. The SPARQLPrompt window will be visible in the bottom right-hand side of the browser.

## Prompting Guidelines
When writing the details of a SPARQL query in plain English be sure to include a mention of these important parts of a SPARQL query:
- what fields should be selected
- what ontology should be queried
- mention whether obsolete terms should be excluded
- mention other conditions that should be matched
- include a Context file for your ontology for detailed instructions to get the most accurate response
- to build up complex queries, start with a basic query and add more conditions as needed for the complexity of the query/information to extract from the ontology.

For detailed information on best practices for prompting to generate SPARQL queries as well as a sample Context file, see the OBO Academy tutorial [Generating SPARQL queries using Large Language Models LLMs](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/tutorial/sparql-llm/#generating-sparql-queries-using-large-language-models-llms)

## OpenAI API Usage and Billing

SPARQLPrompt uses the OpenAI API to generate SPARQL queries. Each query generation consumes API tokens, which may incur costs depending on your OpenAI account plan.

**Pricing Information:**
- SPARQLPrompt currently uses the `gpt-4.1` model
- Current pricing: **$2.00 per 1M input tokens** (as of the latest update)
- For the most up-to-date pricing information, see the [OpenAI Pricing Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing)
- Pricing may vary by model and can change over time

**To check your API usage and billing:**
1. Visit the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account
3. Navigate to **Usage** in the left sidebar to view:
   - Current usage statistics
   - Token consumption by model
   - Cost breakdown
   - Usage limits and quotas
4. Navigate to **Billing** to view:
   - Payment methods
   - Billing history
   - Current balance
   - Spending limits and alerts

**Tips for managing costs:**
- Monitor your usage regularly through the OpenAI dashboard
- Set up usage alerts to be notified when you approach spending limits
- Consider using the `gpt-4.1` model (currently the only available option) which is optimized for cost-effectiveness
- Export your query history regularly to avoid regenerating queries unnecessarily

## Updating to the Latest Version
1. In your local repository, pull the latest code:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Ensure **Developer mode** is enabled (toggle in the upper-right).
4. Locate the SPARQLPrompt card and click the **Reload** button (circular arrow) in the card’s upper-right corner (see the screenshot below).
5. If the SPARQLPrompt window is already open in a YASGUI tab, refresh the page to update the SPARQLPrompt extension.
